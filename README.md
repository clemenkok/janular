Janular for Teams is a Full-Stack application built using MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and Node.js. It aims to give teams and organisations a means of improving innovation through the use of Janular Noticeboards. Team Leaders can create a Janular Noticeboard for their team to view, support and compare ideas.

Janular was my first introduction to the MERN Stack, and Full-Stack development.
